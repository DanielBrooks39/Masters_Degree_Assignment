This is a repository that houese all of the assignments that I have completed for my Masters Degree

## DATA 602 - Advanced Programming Techniques
In this course students will learn aspects of contemporary programming that are important for data gathering and analysis, including real-time programming, GUI design, interactive database programming, service-oriented architecture, data collection with and without databases, machine learning, data mining techniques, and GIS programming. Computer security issues will also be addressed, as will overall computer architecture. Students will be required to create a working system for a large volume of data using publically available data sets.

## DATA 604 - Simulation and Modeling Techniques
This course teaches students the basics of simulation, systems modeling, and related software applications. Topics include event-driven and agent-based simulations, such as generation of random numbers, random variates, design for simulation experiments, gathering statistics, and steady state versus transient state results. The use of combined simulation and optimization will be covered. Students will develop a contextual understanding of simulation and modeling through the use of case studies.

## DATA 605 - Fundamentals and Computational Mathematics
This course will cover basic differential and integral calculus from the viewpoint of numerical methods and some basic probability concepts. The emphasis will be on modeling and applications to a number of different fields that make use of analytics in differing ways: e.g., business, urban systems, social networks. The course will incorporate basic linear and matrix algebra. Statistical programming and modeling packages will be used throughout.

## Data 606 - Statistics and Probability for Data Analytics
This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.

## DATA 607 - Data Acquisition and Management
In this course students will learn about core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include systems for collecting data (real time, sensors, open data sets, etc.) and implications for practice; types of data (textual, quantitative, qualitative, GIS, etc.) and sources; an overview of the use of data, including what and how much should be collected and the distinction between data, information, and knowledge from a data-centric point of view; provenance; managing data with and without databases; computer and data security; data cleaning, fusing, and processing techniques; combining data from different sources; storage techniques including very large data sets; and storing data keeping in mind privacy and security issues.
Students will be required to create a working system for a large volume of data using publically available data sets.

## DATA 608 - Knowledge and Visual Analytics
In this course students will learn non-statistical aspects of elucidating from data its information content which leads to knowledge. Several differing visual techniques will be examined to gain this knowledge through exploratory use of visualizations as well as visualization techniques for presenting data to a variety of stakeholders. Exploratory techniques look to find patterns in the data. Finding patterns that underlie the systemâ€™s characteristics when the data sets are very large or have many dimensions by reducing the dimensionality in intelligent ways is a complex task that often includes user direction. Presentation visualizations provide the viewer with useful information and knowledge since the visualizations are created with context in mind. In addition, students will learn how to integrate quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., text and narrative).

## DATA 609 - Mathematical Modeling Techniques for Data Analytics
In this course students will learn mathematical methods for understanding data relationships and for system optimization. Mathematical modeling techniques for representing a complex system will be presented. Topics to be covered include linear (LP) and non-linear programming (NLP); algorithmic search methods for optimization; branch and bound and dynamic programming, and their uses. Use of modeling packages will be stressed. Examples will be used from actual systems. In addition, students will be expected to explain their models, reports, and analyses in plain and easy-to-understand language.

## DATA 618 - Quantitative Finance
Quantitative finance is a branch of applied mathematics concerned with calculation, modeling, and forecasting in a variety of industry segments. Professionals in this field use specialized knowledge and skills to determine value and calculate risk. Their results can play a key role in business actions such as financing, mergers, consolidations, speculation, and global expansion Students will engage in topics that include probability distributions, linear regression, stochastic calculus, Monte Carlo methods, Black-Scholes, capital asset pricing, and arbitrage pricing. Topics will be presented through academic theory and real-world examples.

## DATA 621 - Business Analytics and Data Mining
This course teaches students to comb through complex business data sets to produce knowledge, and ultimately, business intelligence. Students learn the basics of business analytics. However, this course goes well beyond typical analytics for managers by including rich computational components for predictive and prescriptive analytics. Strategy and operational business contexts are provided via case studies throughout the course. Students will deal with actual business scenarios like sales, marketing, logistics, and finance. Students are expected to bring in practical problems from their own fields of interest. In addition, each student will be responsible for leading discussions in a particular application area. Teamwork is an essential part of the course.

## DATA 622 - Big Data and Machine Learning
### In Progress
This course teaches students to apply advanced machine learning techniques to big data sets. Students will learn how to apply both new and previously studied techniques to large data sets in a distributed computing environment. In particular, the course will make use of the Hadoop framework and the Mahout implementation of machine learning algorithms. Students will also learn to apply basic text mining techniques as well as how to implement a basic recommender system in Hadoop.

## DATA 643 - Advanced Topics in Data Analytics (Recommender Systems)
This course allows the program to offer additional material on advanced and specialty topics within the Data Science field. This will be an advanced class. Emphasis will be placed on project based outcomes.

## Data 698 - Analytics Masters Research Project 
### In Progress
My master research project is centered around sabermetrics (The mathematical study of predicting basbeballe games). I will be using OYthon to scrape the data from a variety of websites and then using R toe creat distrubtions on the pitching, fielding and batting data. I can them take the actual line ups that are being used in the games today, and simulate the events that will take place during the game. I can compare those results to a variety results to test the accuracy of the model.
